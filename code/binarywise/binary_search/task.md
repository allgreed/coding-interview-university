- binary search (on sorted array of integers)
    - [ ] Implement in:
        - [x] C
        - [ ] C++
        - [ ] C++ with builtin types
- binary search using recursion
    - [ ] Implement in:
        - [x] C
        - [ ] C++
        - [ ] C++ with builtin types

- [ ] do a comparison of c iteration | c recursion vs c++ iteration | c++ recursion
- [ ] see how that tail-call optimisation really works in c++ (dissasembly both recursion and iteration, compare)
