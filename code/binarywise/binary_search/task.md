- binary search (on sorted array of integers)
    - [x] Implement in:
        - [x] C
        - [x] C++
        - [x] C++ with builtin types
- binary search using recursion
    - [x] Implement in:
        - [x] C
        - [x] C++
        - [x] C++ with builtin types

- [ ] do a comparison of c++ iteration vs c++ recursion
<!-- https://github.com/google/benchmark -->
- [x] see how that tail-call optimisation really works in c++ (dissasembly both recursion and iteration, compare)

<!-- Same for C++ -->
<!-- Update makefile for bulding with debug symbols -->
<!-- Update makefile for much more -->
<!-- Update makefile for optimized builds -->
<!-- Update makefile for assembly target -->
<!-- Also do assembly optimized -->
<!-- Redo the flagsa to make some senese -->
