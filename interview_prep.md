## Pick One Language for the Interview

You can use a language you are comfortable in to do the coding part of the interview, but for large companies, these are solid choices:

- C++
- Java
- Python

You could also use these, but read around first. There may be caveats:

- JavaScript
- Ruby

You need to be very comfortable in the language and be knowledgeable.

You'll see some C, C++, and Python learning included below, because I'm learning. There are a few books involved, see the bottom.
