## Book List

This is a shorter list than what I used. This is abbreviated to save you time.

### Interview Prep

- [ ] [Programming Interviews Exposed: Secrets to Landing Your Next Job, 2nd Edition](http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-047012167X.html)
    - answers in C++ and Java
    - this is a good warm-up for Cracking the Coding Interview
    - not too difficult, most problems may be easier than what you'll see in an interview (from what I've read)
- [ ] [Cracking the Coding Interview, 6th Edition](http://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-6th-Programming/dp/0984782850/)
    - answers in Java

If you have tons of extra time:

- [ ] [Elements of Programming Interviews (C++ version)](https://www.amazon.com/Elements-Programming-Interviews-Insiders-Guide/dp/1479274836)
- [ ] Elements of Programming Interviews (Java version)
    - [book](https://www.amazon.com/Elements-Programming-Interviews-Java-Insiders/dp/1517435803/)
    - [Companion Project - Method Stub and Test Cases for Every Problem in the Book](https://github.com/gardncl/elements-of-programming-interviews)

### Computer Architecture

If short on time:

- [ ] [Write Great Code: Volume 1: Understanding the Machine](https://www.amazon.com/Write-Great-Code-Understanding-Machine/dp/1593270038)
    - The book was published in 2004, and is somewhat outdated, but it's a terrific resource for understanding a computer in brief.
    - The author invented HLA, so take mentions and examples in HLA with a grain of salt. Not widely used, but decent examples of what assembly looks like.
    - These chapters are worth the read to give you a nice foundation:
        - Chapter 2 - Numeric Representation
        - Chapter 3 - Binary Arithmetic and Bit Operations
        - Chapter 4 - Floating-Point Representation
        - Chapter 5 - Character Representation
        - Chapter 6 - Memory Organization and Access
        - Chapter 7 - Composite Data Types and Memory Objects
        - Chapter 9 - CPU Architecture
        - Chapter 10 - Instruction Set Architecture
        - Chapter 11 - Memory Architecture and Organization

If you have more time (I want this book):

- [ ] [Computer Architecture, Fifth Edition: A Quantitative Approach](https://www.amazon.com/dp/012383872X/)
    - For a richer, more up-to-date (2011), but longer treatment

### Language Specific

**You need to choose a language for the interview (see above).** Here are my recommendations by language. I don't have resources for all languages. I welcome additions.

If you read though one of these, you should have all the data structures and algorithms knowledge you'll need to start doing coding problems.
**You can skip all the video lectures in this project**, unless you'd like a review.

[Additional language-specific resources here.](programming-language-resources.md)

### C++

I haven't read these two, but they are highly rated and written by Sedgewick. He's awesome.

- [ ] [Algorithms in C++, Parts 1-4: Fundamentals, Data Structure, Sorting, Searching](https://www.amazon.com/Algorithms-Parts-1-4-Fundamentals-Structure/dp/0201350882/)
- [ ] [Algorithms in C++ Part 5: Graph Algorithms](https://www.amazon.com/Algorithms-Part-Graph-3rd-Pt-5/dp/0201361183/)

If you have a better recommendation for C++, please let me know. Looking for a comprehensive resource.

### Java

- [ ] [Algorithms (Sedgewick and Wayne)](https://www.amazon.com/Algorithms-4th-Robert-Sedgewick/dp/032157351X/)
    - videos with book content (and Sedgewick!):
        - [Algorithms I](https://www.youtube.com/user/algorithmscourses/playlists?view=50&sort=dd&shelf_id=2)
        - [Algorithms II](https://www.youtube.com/user/algorithmscourses/playlists?shelf_id=3&view=50&sort=dd)

OR:

- [ ] [Data Structures and Algorithms in Java](https://www.amazon.com/Data-Structures-Algorithms-Michael-Goodrich/dp/1118771338/)
    - by Goodrich, Tamassia, Goldwasser
    - used as optional text for CS intro course at UC Berkeley
    - see my book report on the Python version below. This book covers the same topics.

### Python

- [ ] [Data Structures and Algorithms in Python](https://www.amazon.com/Structures-Algorithms-Python-Michael-Goodrich/dp/1118290275/)
    - by Goodrich, Tamassia, Goldwasser
    - I loved this book. It covered everything and more.
    - Pythonic code
    - my glowing book report: https://startupnextdoor.com/book-report-data-structures-and-algorithms-in-python/


### Optional Books

**Some people recommend these, but I think it's going overboard, unless you have many years of software engineering experience and expect a much harder interview:**

- [ ] [Algorithm Design Manual](http://www.amazon.com/Algorithm-Design-Manual-Steven-Skiena/dp/1849967202) (Skiena)
    - As a review and problem recognition
    - The algorithm catalog portion is well beyond the scope of difficulty you'll get in an interview.
    - This book has 2 parts:
        - class textbook on data structures and algorithms
            - pros:
                - is a good review as any algorithms textbook would be
                - nice stories from his experiences solving problems in industry and academia
                - code examples in C
            - cons:
                - can be as dense or impenetrable as CLRS, and in some cases, CLRS may be a better alternative for some subjects
                - chapters 7, 8, 9 can be painful to try to follow, as some items are not explained well or require more brain than I have
                - don't get me wrong: I like Skiena, his teaching style, and mannerisms, but I may not be Stony Brook material.
        - algorithm catalog:
            - this is the real reason you buy this book.
            - about to get to this part. Will update here once I've made my way through it.
    - Can rent it on kindle
    - Half.com is a great resource for textbooks at good prices.
    - Answers:
        - [Solutions](http://www.algorithm.cs.sunysb.edu/algowiki/index.php/The_Algorithms_Design_Manual_(Second_Edition))
        - [Solutions](http://blog.panictank.net/category/algorithmndesignmanualsolutions/page/2/)
    - [Errata](http://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~skiena/algorist/book/errata)

- [ ] [Introduction to Algorithms](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Algorithms-3rd-MIT-Press/dp/0262033844)
    - **Important:** Reading this book will only have limited value. This book is a great review of algorithms and data structures, but won't teach you how to write good code. You have to be able to code a decent solution efficiently.
    - Half.com is a great resource for textbooks at good prices.
    - aka CLR, sometimes CLRS, because Stein was late to the game

- [ ] [Programming Pearls](http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Pearls-2nd-Jon-Bentley/dp/0201657880)
    - The first couple of chapters present clever solutions to programming problems (some very old using data tape) but
      that is just an intro. This a guidebook on program design and architecture, much like Code Complete, but much shorter.
