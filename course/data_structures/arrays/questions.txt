Non trivial questions:

0. typedef struct {} NAME vs struct NAME {}?

Struct does not exist as a type, therefore "struct" before each occurrence of NAME would be required. As it's not very pretty typedef can be utilized.

1. How to make function inline?

Don't think about it. The compiler does it for you.
